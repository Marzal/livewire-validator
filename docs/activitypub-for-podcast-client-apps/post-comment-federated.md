# Post a federated reply comment as a user of another ActivityPub server (not the episode's comment server)

In this scenario, the podcast client app facilitates logging in as an authenticated user of an ActivityPub server that is _not_ the server specified in the RSS feed.

Should be largely the same as the basic [post comment](post-comment.md) scenario, but how to have the user choose their server?
